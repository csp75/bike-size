#This file contains general guidelines for ai code generation

0. elegance always pays off
1. this file contains instructions and guidelines for AI generated code throughout the project
2. generated code will be consumed by LLM based coding tools
3. generated code should be human readable like a book, use pharahraphs and chapters for long code to express abstractions
4. keep it simple
5. use short names, stick to the domain model and ontology names in all components, use names that would help LLM based code tools
6. generate short comments
7. for Kotlin code guidelines read ai_kotlin_guidlines.txt
8. code will change and morph continously, prefer top level function testing
